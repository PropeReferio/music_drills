This is Django app that generates a random music practice routine for me.

I can choose the number of random drills, or specify how many drills for harmonica, piano, bass, etc.

The app is currently running here: [Get your Drills](https://web-production-aa9a.up.railway.app/getdrills/) "Music Drills")
